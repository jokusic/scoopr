## Getting Started

To test out our project in the Android Studio emulator:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open it as a Flutter project in Android Studio
3. Once the project loads, click the "Get Dependencies pop-up to install dependencies. If the pop-up doesn't appear, you can just run `flutter pub get` in the Android Studio terminal.
4. Make sure you have an Android emulator running through the ADK Manager
5. Click the green Run button and the scoopr login screen will open in the emulator!

## Technologies
We made out app using Flutter/Dart and Firebase!
We used Firebase Authentication for account creation and user management, Firestore to store some extra user data, and the Firebase Realtime Database to enable location tracking for ice cream trucks.
